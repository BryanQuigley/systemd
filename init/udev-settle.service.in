# This barrier service is usually not enabled by default. If enabled,
# it acts as a barrier for basic.target -- so all later services will
# wait for udev completely finishing its coldplug run.
#
# It might be enabled just unconditionally, or pulled-in on-demand by
# broken or non-hotplug-aware services that assume a fully populated
# /dev at startup.
