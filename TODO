  o libudev enumerate
      add buses and drivers
      add /sys/block/ scanning crap
      use enumerate for "trigger"
  o libudev queue - interface for /dev/.udev/queue/ state
      use queue interface for "settle"
  o relace test/sys/ with current sysfs layout
  o use libudev device in udev_rules.c
      get rid of udevice, store rule matching state in rule iterator
  o rework rules to a match-action list, instead of a rules array
  o add DVB variables to kernel, and drop shell script rule
  o add watershed extra
  o log warning if the kernel uses CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED*=y,
    which means that /sys/class/block/ does not exist, but udev
    will depend on it in a future release
  o DEVTYPE for disks is set by the kernel, they will be removed from
    the default rules
  o "udevadm control" commands will only accept the --<command> syntax
  o symlink names to udevadm will no longer be resolved to old command names
  o get distros to agree on a default set of rules
