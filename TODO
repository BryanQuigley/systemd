This is a list of things that needs to be done. They are in no specific
order.  We will gladly accept patches for any of these items:

- Completely replace the built-in wait_for_sysfs stuff in udev_sysfs.c
  by rules using the WAIT_FOR_SYSFS key.

- Log the relationship of the kernel name and the persistent disk name
  to syslog, so any error logged from the kernel can be associated with
  any of the links at that time.
