These things would be nice to have:


These things will change in future udev versions:
  o warn if BUS, ID, SYSFS are used as keys
    (they are SUBSYSTEMS, KERNELS, ATTRS now)

  o warn if links to udevadm are used

These things are deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future
udev version:
  o some day, remove all symlinks to udevadm
