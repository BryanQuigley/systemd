These things would be nice to have:
  o get all distros to agree on a default set of rules
  o rework rules to a match-action list, instead of a rules array

These things will change in future udev versions:
  o --device-id-of-file will print '5:8' instead of '5 8'

These things are deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future udev version:
  o DEVTYPE for disks is set by the kernel, remove it from the rules
