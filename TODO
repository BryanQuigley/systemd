This is a short list of things that needs to be done.  They are in no specific
order.  We will gladly accept patches for any of these items:

- More documentation:
    Allmost all extras/*_id/  programs don't have a man page
    some details are missing in the udev man pages.

- Completely replace the built-in wait_for_sysfs stuff in udev_sysfs.c
  by rules using the WAIT_FOR_SYSFS key.

- Log the relationship of the kernel name and the persistent disk name
  to syslog, so any error logged from the kernel can be associated with
  any of the links.

- Do generic early boot logic:
    initramfs, pivot-root, cover coldplug or event replay, etc...

- Keep the distro rules in etc/ up-to-date.
