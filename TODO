This is a short list of things that needs to be done.  They are in no specific
order.  I will gladly accept patches for any of these items, or any other stuff
people offer up.

- more documentation (can never have too much.)
- create way to set permission to the local user.
- install the proper init.d script based on the distro we are running on.
- persuade the distro packagers to submit their changes (or just steal them
  if we can find them...)
- create kernel name to devfs name config file so that all of the devfs users
  will have an upgrade path.
- do early boot logic (putting udev into initramfs, handle pivot-root,
  etc.)
- lots of other stuff...
