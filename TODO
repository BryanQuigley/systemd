F15:

* swap units that are activated by one name but shown in the kernel under another are semi-broken

* isolate multi-user.target doesn't start a getty@tty1 if we run it from graphical.target
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=688661

* NFS, networkmanager ordering issue (PENDING)

* NM should pull in network.target (PENDING)
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692008

* ntpd should pull in time-sync.target. (PENDING)

* add fstab fields to add wait timeouts, change Wants to Requires by local-fs.target

* hook emergency.target into local-fs.target in some way as OnFailure with isolate

* bind mounts are ignored
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=682662

* 0595f9a1c182a84581749823ef47c5f292e545f9 is borked, freezes shutdown
    (path: after installing inotify watches, recheck file again to fix race)

* bluetooth should be possible to disable

* fix alsa mixer restore to not print error when no config is stored

Features:

* don't trim empty cgroups
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=678555

* serialize used job ids and max job id

* show enablement status in systemctl status

* expose monotonic timestamps on the bus and make systemd-analyze use it

* write blog stories about:
  - chroot, nspawn and friends
  - the blame game: systemd-analyze
  - enabling dbus services
  - status update

* allow port = 0 in .socket units

* rename systemd-logger to systemd-stdio-syslog-bridge

* introduce /usr/lib/binfmt.d/, /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/

* in pam_systemd: don't rely on /proc/self/loginuid in a container

* take BSD file lock on tty devices when using them?

* tmpfiles should allow two identical lines
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690253

* avoid any flag files, or readahead files in /, we need to support r/o /
  or / on tmpfs like Android setups.

* teach dbus to activate all services it finds in /etc/systemd/services/org-*.service

* get process transport into dbus for systemctl -P/-H

* document default dependencies

* support systemd.whitelist=/systemd.blacklist= on the kernel command
  line.

* Find a way to replace /var/run, /var/lock directories with
  symlinks during an RPM package upgrade (filesystem.rpm or systemd.rpm).
  We soon want to get rid of var-run.mount var-lock.mount units.

* when key file cannot be found, read it from kbd in cryptsetup

* get rid of random file name in generator directory?
    /run/systemd/generator-IH1vFu

* add switch to systemctl to show enabled but not running services. Or
  another switch that shows service that have been running since
  booting but aren't running anymore.

* reuse mkdtemp namespace dirs in /tmp?

* don't strip facility from kmsg log messages as soon as that is possible:
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=9d90c8d9cde929cbc575098e825d7c29d9f45054

* recreate systemd's D-Bus private socket file on SIGUSR2

* be more specific what failed:
    ...
    Unmounting file systems.
    Not all file systems unmounted, 1 left.
    Disabling swaps.
    Detaching loop devices.
    Detaching DM devices.
    Cannot finalize remaining file systems and devices, trying to kill remaining processes.
    Unmounting file systems.
    Not all file systems unmounted, 1 left.
    Cannot finalize remaining file systems and devices, giving up.
    ...

* check for compiled-in, but not active selinux, and don't print any warnings
  about policy loading. Probably check for available selinux in /proc/filesystems,
  and check for active selinux with getcon_raw() == "kernel"

* optionally create watched directories in .path units

* Support --test based on current system state

* consider services with no [Install] section and stored in /lib enabled by "systemctl is-enabled"

* consider services with any kind of link in /etc/systemd/system enabled

* show failure error string in "systemctl status"

* make sure timeouts are applied to Type=oneshot services.

* Maybe implement "systemctl mask" and "systemctl unmask", but not
  document it? When doing that add switch to make this temporary by
  placing mask links in /dev.
  Consider moving the actual fs operations into systemd behind a D-Bus
  interface, to make namespaces/containers/remote connections work properly.

* detect LXC environment

* invoke vhangup() before and after invoking getty
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=3c95c985fa91ecf6a0e29622bbdd13dcfc5ce9f1

* support "auto" and "comment=systemd.automount" at the same time for an fstab entry

* Maybe store in unit files whether a service should be enabled by default on package installation
  (belongs into a distro pattern though, not in an upstream package's service file)

* perhaps add "systemctl reenable" as combination of "systemctl disable" and "systemctl enable"

* need a way to apply mount options of api vfs from systemd unit files
  (or some other modern source?) instead of fstab

* maybe introduce ExecRestartPre=

* figure out what happened to bluez patch

* Patch systemd-fsck to use -C and pass console fd to it

* support remote/ssh systemctl/systemadm, and local privileged access → dbus patches need to be merged

* configurable jitter for timer events

* Support ProcessNeededForShutdown=true to allow stuff like mdmon
  to be killed very late after the rootfs is read only (?)

* Integrate "mdadm --wait-clean". Maybe just let SIGTERM to mdmon trigger the
  needed action

* dot output for --test showing the 'initial transaction'

* calendar time support in timer, iCalendar semantics for the timer stuff (RFC2445)
  - check timerfd() patch: http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/11/23/290

* systemd --user
  - get PR_SET_ANCHOR merged: http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/2/2/165

* add VT tracking:
  - provide CK functionality
  - start getty only when actual vt switch happens (same model as
    socket on-demand activation). allocate the next free tty and
    start a getty there. this way, pressing alt-f[1-12] will switch
    through running X and getty sessions, and any unallocated
    activated tty will start a new getty. the hardcoding of
    getty[1-6] will entirely go away.

* implicitly import "defaults" settings file into all types

* port over to LISTEN_FDS/LISTEN_PID:
   - uuidd    HAVEPATCH
   - rpcbind (/var/run/rpcbind.sock!) HAVEPATCH
   - cups     HAVEPATCH
   - postfix, saslauthd
   - apache/samba
   - libvirtd (/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro)
   - bluetoothd (/var/run/sdp! @/org/bluez/audio!)
   - distccd

* fingerprint.target, wireless.target, gps.target, netdevice.target

* set_put(), hashmap_put() return values check. i.e. == 0 doesn't free()!

* io priority during initialization

* if a service fails too often, make the service enter failed mode, and the socket, too.

* systemctl list-jobs - show dependencies

* accountsservice is borked

* auditd service files

* add systemctl switch to dump transaction without executing it

* suspend, resume support?

* readahead: btrfs/LVM SSD detection

* add separate man page for [Install] settings

* allow runtime changing of log level and target

External:

* udisks should not use udisks-part-id, instead use blkid. also not probe /dev/loopxxx

* snd-seq should go, https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=676095

* gnome-shell python script/glxinfo/is-accelerated must die

* make cryptsetup lower --iter-time

* patch kernel for xattr support in /dev, /proc/, /sys and /sys/fs/cgroup.

* patch kernel for cpu feature modalias for autoloading aes/kvm/...
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/ak/linux-misc-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/cpuid-match
  (Rafael J. Wysocki's sysdev rework is on the way. After that CPUs can be exported a proper bus.)

* procps, psmisc, sysvinit-tools, hostname → util-linux-ng

Regularly:

* look for close() vs. close_nointr() vs. close_nointr_nofail()

* check for strerror(r) instead of strerror(-r)

* Use PR_SET_PROCTITLE_AREA if it becomes available in the kernel

* %m in printf() instead of strerror();

* pahole

* CFLAGS="-Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--print-gc-sections -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections"
