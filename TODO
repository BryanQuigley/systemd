  o drop support for node names in name stack, support only symlinks
     With well defined and kernel-supplied node names, we no longer need
     to support a possible stack of conflicting symlinks and node names.
     From there on, only symlinks with identical names can be claimed
     by multiple devices. It will simplify the logic a lot and shrink
     /dev/.udev/names/ significantly. Also exclude "*/MAJ:MIN" link names
     from the name stack, they can not conflict.
  o remove most NAME= rules (they are provided by the 2.6.31 kernel)
  o convert firmware.sh to C
  o "udevadm control" commands will only accept the --<command> syntax
  o get rid of braindead "scan all devices to find myself" libusb interface
      if it can not be fixed, drop libusb entirely
  o remove copy of bsg.h
  o drop all support for the DEPRECATED sysfs layout
  o add warning for BUS, SYSFS, ID
