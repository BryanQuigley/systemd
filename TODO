This is a short list of things that needs to be done.  They are in no specific
order.  I will gladly accept patches for any of these items, or any other stuff
people offer up.

- more documentation (can never have too much.)
- persuade the distro packagers to submit their changes (or just steal them
  if we can find them...)
- do early boot logic (putting udev into initramfs, handle pivot-root,
  etc.)
- solve world hunger
