- Add an option to replace blanks with spaces, so the generated id can be
  more easily used as a /dev name.

- Add a bus white/black list option. So for example, all scsi devices
  under USB could easily be blacklisted. This should allow multiple busses
  to be listed.

- Add code to check that  SCSI commands get back enough data for their
  intended usage, mainly callers of scsi_inquiry().

- Document the config file in the man page
