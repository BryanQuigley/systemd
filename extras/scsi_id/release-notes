Version 0.4 of scsi_id is available at:

http://www-124.ibm.com/storageio/scsi_id/scsi_id-0.4.tar.gz

scsi_id is a program to generate a unique identifier for a given SCSI
device.

It is primarily for use with the udev callout key. It could also be used
for automatic multi-path configuration or device mapper configuration.

Version 0.4 requires:

- Linux kernel 2.6
- libsysfs 0.4.0

Major changes since the last release:

	- Support block device partitions

	- Added a script to auto-generate udev rules. The script is not
	  installed but is part of the tarball.

Detailed changes:

	- Add man page verbage about usage with udev, and running via
	  hotplug

	- Disable support for -e (all output to stderr) as it cannot be
	  used in any useful way, and the -c (device specific callout) as
	  the code is incomplete and has no users.

	- Don't print errno for NULL return from sysfs_get_classdev_device.

	- Get rid of dead/leftover code that checked if we are on a scsi
	  bus.

	- ":" consistently in output messages.

	- Add missing new lines for some error messages.

	- open O_NONBLOCK so we handle tape drives without tapes loaded.

	- Remove hacks based on KLIBC define to get around problems when
	  building with udev (udev libsysfs files were rearranged).

	- As done in udev code, support partitions via looking for a
	  parent of the target path. Uses libsysfs functions to do most of
	  the work, and includes changing a lot of variables to be struct
	  sysfs_device instead of sysfs_class_device.
