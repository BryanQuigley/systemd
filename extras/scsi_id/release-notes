Version 0.6 of scsi_id is available at:

http://www-124.ibm.com/storageio/scsi_id/scsi_id-0.6.tar.gz

scsi_id is a program to generate a unique identifier for a given SCSI
device.

It is primarily for use with the udev program key, or hotplug scripts that
want persistent naming of scsi devices. It could also be used for
automatic multi-path configuration or device mapper configuration.

Requires:

- Linux kernel 2.6
- libsysfs 0.4.0

Major changes since the last release:
	
	- add -u option, patch from Christoph Varoqui, to substitute white
	  space with underscores so it is easier to use the output as a
	  device name.

	- Use 254 bytes for SCSI INQUIRY commands, patch from Hannes
	  Reinecke.

See ChangeLog for more details.
