Chassis_id is a callout program which is used to give geographic names to devices.  It uses
another callout program scsi_id to determine the serial number of a device and then looks up
the provisioning table based on this key. It retrieves  geographic information 
( chassis#, slot# and host# ) about the device and prints it to stdout. These fields are
used by udev to create the device entry.

Using Udev:
~~~~~~~~~~
Chassis_id gets invoked by udev using the udev as below:

BUS="scsi", PROGRAM="/usr/local/bin/chassis_id", NAME="/chassis%c{1}/slot%c{2}/host%c{3}/disk-%c{4}

The provisioning table ( file provision.tbl ) has to be put in /usr/local/bin and as of now has
to be populated manually. This is the only place where the geographic map of devices is kept
in the system.


Usage Model:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
On ATCA based blade architecture systems, blade insertion/removal is common. We create names
in a 3 level deep tree which represent the geographic map of the devices.
