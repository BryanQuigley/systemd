Udev does not come pre-installed on a Linux system. Hence, we need to do the following before
a Linux system is ready ::

Steps:
~~~~~
1.  Install libsysfs shared libraries by installing sysfsutils-0.4.0.

2.  Download latest version of udev from www.kernel.org site. It is
    under repository->utils->kernel path chain.

    Do make and make install so as to install udev. To install scsi_id,
    go into extras/scsi_id folder to compile scsi_id. Typically, this
    would be in /sbin folder.  Now, change scsi_id.cfg and set the
    global option to work with all devices ( -g) and comment out the
    black list option ( -b ).

3.  Download chassis_id callout code and compile. Install chassis_id and
    provision.tbl file in /usr/local/bin.

4.  In /etc/rc.sysinit, add mount command to mount the sys memory file
    system. ( mount -t sysfs sys /sys ). The /sys is necessary as
    lot of the software components expect it to be in /sys.

5.  Now, in /etc/udev/udev.rules, install the udev rules file. This
    is the GDN config file which is used by udev to create folders
    in the form chasis<N>/slot<M>/port<O>/disk<P>.

6.  Now, you are almost there. Refer to PROVISIONING file.


PROVISIONING:
1.  For GDN, the provisioning file is in the format :
   <id>  <host>   <number_of_disks>     <chassis#>    <slot#>  <serial#>  <name>

   <host>            SCSI host on which the device is connected
   <Number of disks> how many disks on this blade ?
   <chassis#>        chassis Number
   <slot#>           Physical slot number
   <serial#>         Serial Number for the disk
   <name>            Name of the disk device.

2.  To fill the provisioning table, the user needs to collect this information and
    fill provision.tbl.

    The serial number is found from the command scsi_id -p 0x80 -s <device name>.

    The host number is availble from the sys file system. The chassis & slot
    are visual data and should be enetered into provision.tbl.
