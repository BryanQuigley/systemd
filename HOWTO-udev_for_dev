HOWTO use udev to manage /dev

  This document describes one way to get udev working on a Fedora-development
  machine to manage /dev.  This procedure may be used to get udev to manage
  /dev on other distros, if you modify some of the steps.
  
  This will only work if you use a 2.6 based kernel, preferably the most
  recent one.  This does not prevent your machine from using a 2.4
  kernel, if you boot into one, udev will not run and your old /dev will
  be present with no changes needed.


NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
  This is completely unsupported.  Attempting to do this may cause your
  machine to be unable to boot properly.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Always
  have a rescue disk or CD handy to allow you to fix up any errors that
  may occur.

 - Build and install udev as specified in the README that comes with
   udev.  I recommend using the following build options to get the
   smallest possible binaries:
	make USE_KLIBC=true USE_LOG=false DEBUG=false

 - disable udev from the boot process by running:
 	chkconfig udev off
   or
   	chkconfig --del udev
   as root.

 - place the start_udev script somewhere that is accessible by your
   initscripts.  I placed it into /etc/rc.d with the following command:
	copy extras/start_udev /etc/rc.d/
	
 - modify the rc.sysinit script to call the start_udev script as one of
   the first things that it does, but after /proc and /sys are mounted.
   I did this with the latest Fedora startup scripts with the patch at
   the end of this file.

 - make sure the /etc/udev/udev.conf file lists the udev_root as "/dev/"
   and the udev_db as "/dev/.udev.tdb". It should contain the
   following lines in order to work properly.
	udev_root="/dev/"
	udev_db="/dev/.udev.tdb"

 - reboot into a 2.6 kernel and watch udev create all of the initial
   device nodes in /dev


If anyone has any problems with this, please let me, and the
linux-hotplug-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list know.

A big thanks go out to the Gentoo developers for showing me that this is
possible to do.
