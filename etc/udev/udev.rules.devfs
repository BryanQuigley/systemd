# These rules are to try to emulate a devfs naming scheme in udev
# if there are any missing rules, please let the udev developers
# know.
#
# There are a number of modifiers that are allowed to be used in the
# a number of the different fields. They provide the following subsitutions:
# %n - the "kernel number" of the device.
#      for example, 'sda3' has a "kernel number" of '3'
# %M - the kernel major number for the device
# %m - the kernel minor number for the device
# %b - the bus id for the device
# %c - the return value for the CALLOUT program (note, this doesn't work within
#      the PROGRAM field for the obvious reason.)
# %D - use the devfs style disk name for this device.
#      For partitions, this will result in 'part%n'
#      If this is not a partition, it will result in 'disc'
