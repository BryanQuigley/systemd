udev 056
========
Possible use of a system-wide klibc:
  make USE_KLIB=true KLCC=/usr/bin/klcc all
will link against an external klibc and our own version will be ignored.

udev 055
========
We support an unlimited count of symlinks now.

If USE_STATIC=true is passed to a glibc build, we link statically and use
a built-in userdb parser to resolve user and group names.

The PLACE= key is gone. It can be replaced by an ID= for a long time, cause
we walk up the chain of physical devices to find a match.

The KEY="<value>" format supports '=', '==', '!=,' , '+=' now. This makes it
easy to skip certain attribute matches without composing rules with weird
character class negations like:
  KERNEL="[!s][!c][!d]*"
this can now be replaced with:
  KERNEL!="scd*"
The current simple '=' is still supported, and should work as it does today,
but existing rules should be converted if possible, to be better readable.

We have new ENV{}== key now, to match against a maximum of 5 environment
variables.

udevstart is its own binary again, cause we don't need co carry this araound
with every forked event.
