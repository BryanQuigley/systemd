========
We support an unlimited count of symlinks now.

If USE_STATIC=true is passed to a glibc build, we link statically and use
a built-in userdb parser to resolve user and group names.

THE PLACE= key is gone. It can be replaced by an ID= for a long time, cause
we walk up the chain of physical devices to find a match.

The KEY="<value>" format supports '=', '==', '!=,' , '+=' now. This makes it
easy to skip certain attribute matches without composing rules with weird
character class negations like:
  KERNEL="[!s][!c][!d]*"

this can now be replaced with:
  KERNEL!="scd*"

The current simple '=' is still supported, and should work as it does today,
but existing rules should be converted if possible, to be better readable.
