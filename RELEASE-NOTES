========
We support an unlimited count of symlinks now.

If USE_STATIC=true is passed to a glibc build, we link statically and use
a built-in userdb parser to resolve user and group names.

THE PLACE= key is gone. It can be replaced by an ID= for a long time, cause
we walk up the chain of physical devices to find a match.
