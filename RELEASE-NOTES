========
We support an unlimited count of symlinks now.

If USE_STATIC=true is passed to a glibc build, we link statically and use
a built-in userdb parser to resolve user and group names.

THE PLACE= key is gone. It can be replaced by an ID= for a long time, cause
we walk up the chain of physical devices to find a match.

The KEY="<value>" format supports '=', '==', '!=,' , '+=' now. This makes it
easier to skip certain devices without composing rules with weird character
class negations like:
  KERNEL="[!s][!c][!d]*"

this can be replaced by:
  KERNEL!="scd*"

The simple '=' is still supported, but the rules should be converted if
possible, to be better human-readable.
